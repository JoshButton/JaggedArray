<h3>BRIEF</h3>
Write a Java program called JaggedArray.java which is constructing a triangular Matrix of integers with N rows and increasing the number of columns in each row, e.g., the first row has one column, the second row has two columns, and the third row has three columns and so on. Hence, the contents of array should be similar to the following example for N = 6:<br>
1<br>
2, 3<br>
4, 5, 6<br>
7, 8, 9, 10<br>
11, 12, 13, 14, 15<br>
16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21<br>
